            Soul music is a combination of R&B (Rhythm and Blues) and gospel music and began in the late 1950s in the
            United States.<br>
            While Soul has a lot in common with R&B, its differences include its use of gospel-music devices, its
            greater emphasis on vocalists,
            and its merging of religious and secular themes.<br>More than any other genre of popular American music,
            Soul is the result of the
            combination and merging of previous styles and substyles in the 1950s and 60s.<br> Broadly speaking,the soul
            comes from a gospel (the sacred) and blues (the profane).<br>
            Blues was mainly a musical style that praised the fleshly desire whereas gospel was more oriented toward
            spiritual inspiration.<br><br>
            The 1950s recordings of Black R&B performers Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and James Brown are commonly considered
            the beginnings of Soul music.<br>Following their success, White artists such as Elvis Presley and Buddy
            Holly
            adopted the sound, removing most of the gospel message but keeping the same musical techniques,
            instrumentation, and feeling.<br>
            Once it gained popularity among White musical groups, a new genre emerged called "Blue-Eyed Soul.<br>" The
            Righteous Brothers actually named one of their albums Blue-Eyed Soul, while artists such as Dusty
            Springfield and Tom Jones were sometimes described as blue-eyed soul singers because of the soulful nature
            of their lyrics and sound.

        <p>
            Tony Scott (born Anthony Joseph Sciacca June 17, 1921 March 28, 2007) was an American jazz
            clarinetist and arranger with an interest in folk music around the world.<br> For most of his career he was
            held
            in high esteem in new-age music circles because of his involvement in music linked to Asian cultures and to
            meditation.<br>In 1959, he left New York City, where he had been based, and abandoned the United States for
            a time.<br> In the 1960s, he toured South, East, and Southeast Asia.<br> This led to his playing in a Hindu
            temple, spending time in Japan, and releasing Music for Zen Meditation in 1964 for Verve Records.<br> In
            1960 a
            DownBeat poll for Japan saw readers there name him best clarinetist while the United States preferred
            Buddy DeFranco.
